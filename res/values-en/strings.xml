    <string name="explications">Different treasures are hidden around you: scan your surroundings
        with your device and find them by following the different Xs.
        To bring one to light, get closer and click when the X becomes red,
        or double-click if the object seems to be behind an obstacle or somewhere inaccessible.\n
        Careful: you have limited time (which you can choose), but you get 5 more seconds for every
        object you find.\n\nGood luck!</string>
